# Pico8 🕹️
My pico8 game monorepo.

Since pico-8 games are all stored in *.p8.png files, I figured it would be nice to keep all my projects in the same place. 

## Folder Structure
```
carts/ -- contains all the game files
├─ my_game.p8.png
├─ my_other_game.p8.png
resources/ -- contains any extra assets / lua libs
├─ assets/
│  ├─ sprites.png
├─ lib/
│  ├─ my_lib.lua
README.md
```
